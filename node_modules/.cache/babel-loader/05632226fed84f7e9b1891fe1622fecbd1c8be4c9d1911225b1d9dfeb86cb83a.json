Fully-draped</h2>\n      <ol>\n        <li>'Sling'-drape, preferred for youths facing to right. The right arm is bent at the elbow and is extended in a slightly upwards direction beneath the cloak, giving it something of the appearance of being confined in a sling. The left hand is concealed beneath the drapery; the right hand may also be concealed, but may also be visible outside the 'sling' (r), in which case it will usually be holding some object, like a spray, a fillet, a ball or a 'skewer of fruit'.</li>\n        <li>'Sleeve' drape, preferred for youths facing to left. The left arm is akimbo, with the himation over it assuming the appearance of a sleeve, the effect of which is heightened by the striped border of the cloak running round the outer edge of the 'sleeve'. The right hand is normally visible (r), projecting slightly outward from beneath the cloak and often holding some object, but it may also be concealed within the cloak.</li>\n        <li>The 'V or 'U' drape, used for youths facing in either direction.\n          <ul>\n            <li>The body is normally shown in a near-frontal view, with the head in profile to right or left. The himation is draped over both shoulders so as to leave a V- or U-shaped opening over the chest, and this is emphasised by the presence of the black or dot-stripe border of the cloak. With this draping, both hands are normally concealed (c), but sometimes the left hand is visible (1), usually holding some object. The right hand is very seldom visible (r; Copenhagen 8377, Paestum 31728, Berlin F3050, and Copenhagen 257 B); when it is, just the hand appears at the bottom of the U, the arm being concealed by the drapery.

Both hands (v) or either the right (r) or the left (1) may be visible, but as yet there are no examples of both being concealed.
